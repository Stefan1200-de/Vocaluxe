## 1. About
Vocaluxe is a free and open source singing game, inspired by the original UltraStar (developed by corvus5) and the great Ultrastar Deluxe project - yet it is an entirely new development in C#.   
It allows up to six players to sing along with music using microphones in order to score points, depending on the pitch of the voice and the rhythm of singing.
It features mouse, keyboard, gamepad and Wiimote navigation, a multi-language interface, and singer profiles with avatars and supports songs in CP1250/52 and UTF8 encodings.   
Vocaluxe offers diversified party modes and can optionally be controlled via a browser (desktop and mobile supported).

Supported Operating Systems / Requirements:
- Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 with .NET 4.0
- *Linux* (no official support)
- 1 GHz CPU, 512 MB RAM, Graphics card with OpenGL 2.1 or DirectX 9.0 support
- Visual C++ Redistributable Package 2010

## 1.1. Fork by Stefan1200
This is a fork from the official release-0.4.1 branch, because 2019 nothing was changed at the official Vocaluxe project and none of the main Vocaluxe developer seemed to be active. My own binary releases require Windows 10 x64, because I use the default Visual Studio 2019 compiling target.

Since early January 2020 I'm now part of the official Vocaluxe project, so the official nightlies got new features and bugfixes. Check it out on the official Vocaluxe website or GitHub page.

If you still want to use my 0.4.1 release, check out my releases on this GitHub page: https://github.com/Stefan1200-de/Vocaluxe/releases
But I don't continue developing this fork, because I continue the work on the official release.
All other parts of this readme file will be kept in the original state.
